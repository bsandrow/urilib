urilib
======

A Python library for handling URIs and URLs. It is based off of my experience
with Perl's URI and URI::URL, which I find infinitely more usable than what
Python currently has to offer.

This is also a response to the fact that there isn't much along the lines of
processing URIs/URLs in Python, and it took all the way until 2.7 for Python to
get a function in the standard library for breaking apart a URL into it's
component parts.
